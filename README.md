# Calorie Count

I was looking for an excuse to play with Webpack2 and Emotion so I threw this calculator together. The inspiration came from a pending move to the 21st floor of an office building at work. We have a cafeteria so I wanted a quick way to figure out how many flights of stairs I would need to take to make my snack calorie neutral.

Honestly I realize that almost all of my projects are in private repos, and I'd like to start creating some public projects. Hopefully this serves as my gateway project.

The project is running at http://calorieclimb.eisenberg.ninja. I'm hosting it with Surge.sh, which is quickly turning into my favorite thing about the internet.
